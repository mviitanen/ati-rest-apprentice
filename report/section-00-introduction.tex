The Java Apprentice Badge is the first badge in the Java series. It covers intermediate concepts of Java programming. It is not a 101 course in programming, so many of the common language features are not covered. The requirements don't include installation, the Java language syntax, or basic computer science concepts such as looping and conditionals.

The high-level requirements\footnote{See confluence for full description of the requirements at \url{https://almtools.ldschurch.org/fhconfluence/display/Product/Core+Skills+-+Java+-+Apprentice} .} include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Object life cycle
\item Exceptions
\item Polymorphism
\item Collections
\item Using a library
\end{itemize}
